# World Engine Unity SDK [WIP]

World Engine Unity SDK provides a C# client library for interacting with World Engine that provides convenient wrapper and helper methods around the current Nakama SDK.

**⚠️ While this SDK have been used in production, it is still a work in progress and we expect significant changes to the API and behavior in the near future.**

We encourage using the Nakama SDK directly for now. For guidance on how to do this, see World Engine's [Nakama SDK 
integration guide](https://world.dev/client/nakama/overview)
